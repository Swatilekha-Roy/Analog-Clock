# Analog-clock
- This is a very simple analog clock which will display the time in a place (accessible in all time zones) through its hand movements (hour hand, minute hand, second hand). 
- On hovering over or clicking on clock, full time and date in LocaleString format is displayed.
- There is also a stopwatch onscreen with play, pause and reset buttons for use.
- Dark mode and Light mode can be swapped with the toggle button on top.
- Neomorphic/ Minimalistic designed interface.
- Responsive design, therefore, can be viewed and used comfortably on all screen sizes.
- Implemented using HTML 5, CSS 3 and simple JavaScript.
- Find a demo of the clock and stopwatch at https://swatilekha-roy.github.io/Analog-clock
- All improvements and addition of any features or suggestions are wholeheartedly welcome.
